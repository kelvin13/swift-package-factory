**`factory`** is a structured, type-safe source generation tool. It is intended to be a replacement for (and improvement over) the `gyb` tool!

`factory` is powered by [`swift-syntax`](https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax), so it evolves with the toolchain. **You cannot run it with the 5.6.2 release toolchain**, because the 5.6.2 toolchain is too old and does not support the API `factory` needs to transform your sources safely. 

The current toolchain pin is: 

[**`swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2022-09-27-a`**](https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/tags)

Swift files *generated* by `factory` are still backwards compatible, in fact one of the main use cases of `factory` is back-deployment.

## Platforms 

SPF officially supports Linux and macOS. 

Please note that on macOS, SPM sets the [wrong `@rpath`](https://forums.swift.org/t/5-8-compiler-sets-rpath-to-usr-lib-swift-5-5-macosx-why/59797) by default, so you will need to manually add a symlink to `lib_InternalSwiftSyntaxParser.dylib` inside your build artifacts directory.

## Overview 

`factory` was designed with the following goals in mind:

1.  Template files should look like normal `.swift` files, so highlighters and IDEs donâ€™t freak out. 

2.  Templates should be **safe**, and prohibit arbitrary string splicing or token substitutions.

3.  Templates should work well with documentation comments.

4.  Template syntax should be minimal, purely additive, and source generation tooling should accept and return vanilla `.swift` sources unchanged.

5.  Template users should be able to use as much or as little templating as they like, and using templating on one declaration should not increase the cognitive burden of the rest of the code in the file.

6.  Templating systems should nudge users towards using **the least amount of templating necessary** for their use-case.

7.  Template sources should be self-explanatory, and understandable by developers who have never heard of `swift-package-factory`.

8.  Template users should be able to *stop* using a templating system, and be able to assume responsibility for maintaining generated `.swift` files at any time.

In a nutshell:

    var __ordinal__:Int 
    {

    enum Cases:Int
    {
        @matrix(__case__: cases)
        case __case__
    }

    @matrix(__case__: cases)

    var __case__:Self 
    {
        Cases.__case__.rawValue
    }
}

    {
        case a
        case b
    }

    var a:Self 
    {
        Cases.a.rawValue
    }

    public static 
    var b:Self 
    {
        Cases.b.rawValue
    }
}

## Features 

`factory` extends the Swift language with three attributes:

1.  **`@basis`**

    Defines a sequence of tokens to iterate over when generating declarations from a template. It can be applied to a `let` binding, and it must be initialized with an array literal. 

    The declaration it is attached to will be removed from the generated `.swift` code, along with any associated comments and doccomments.

2.  **`@matrix`**

    Replicates the declaration it is attached to, along with any associated comments and doccomments. It takes `@basis` bindings or and/or inline array literals as arguments, with the name of the argument becoming the name of the loop variable. If more than one basis is given, `@matrix` zips them, and will discard trailing basis elements if their lengths differ.
    
    `@matrix` can be applied to an `associatedtype`, `actor`, `class`, `case`, `enum`, `extension`, `func`, `import`, `init`, `operator`, precedence group, `protocol`, `struct`, `subscript`, `typealias`, `let`, or `var` declaration.

3.  **`@retro`** 

    Downgrades a protocol with primary associated types to a protocol without any, and gates the two variants by `#if swift(>=5.7)`. It can be applied to a `protocol` with at least one primary `associatedtype`.

    `@retro` copies any comments and doccomments attached to the original `protocol`, and includes them in the generated `#if` blocks.
